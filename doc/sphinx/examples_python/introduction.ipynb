    "In addition to the [graphical user interface](https://pairinteraction.github.io/images/screen-win64.png), the pairinteraction software includes a library. The library can be used to write your own code and have more fine-grained control over what pairinteraction does, e.g. for searching optimal experimental parameters or calculating effective Hamiltonians and simulating Rydberg experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is fully written in C++ to obtain high performance. It provides a Python API generated with [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) so that one can work with all the functionality of the library in Python. The Python functions mirror the eponymous wrapped C++ functions. Thus, it is straight forward to transfer code between the two programming languages. The following introduction, which can be [downloaded](https://github.com/pairinteraction/pairinteraction/blob/master/doc/sphinx/examples_python/introduction.ipynb) as a Jupyter notebook, shows the basic usage of the pairinteraction library in Python 3. The physics behind the presented calculations is reviewed in the pairinteraction paper: S. Weber, C. Tresp, H. Menke, A. Urvoy, O. Firstenberg, H. P. BÃ¼chler, S. Hofferberth, [J. Phys. B: At. Mol.

    "### Installation\n",
    "By installing a [binary build of the pairinteraction software](https://github.com/pairinteraction/pairinteraction/releases), the pairinteraction Python library gets installed, too. For GNU/Linux, all dependencies of the pairinteraction library are installed automatically as well, and the library can be used right away. For Windows or OS X, we recommend the installation of the Python 3 distribution [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Then, the dependencies can be installed by executing ``conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pyzmq`` within the Anaconda terminal prompt. Its important that the installed version of the `numpy` library is up-to-date. "

We use the module `pireal` of the pairinteraction library as the calculations shown in this introduction require only real numbers (if one considers electric or magnetic fields with a non-zero $y$-value, complex numbers occur due to the definition of the spherical basis and one must use `picomplex`)."

The species-specific quantum defects and model potential parameters are stored in a database, created from a [SQL file](https://github.com/pairinteraction/pairinteraction/blob/master/libpairinteraction/databases/quantum_defects.sql).
