    "In addition to the [graphical user interface](https://pairinteraction.github.io/images/screen-win64.png), the pairinteraction software can be used as a library. The library provides functionality which can be applied by the user to write its own code, e.g. for searching optimal experimental parameters or calculating effective Hamiltonians and simulating Rydberg experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is fully written in C++ to obtain a high performance. It provides a Python wrapper generated with [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) so that one can work with all the functionality of the library in Python. The Python functions are named the same as the wrapped C++ functions so that it is straight forward to transfer code between the two programming languages. The following introduction, which can be [downloaded](https://github.com/pairinteraction/pairinteraction/blob/master/doc/sphinx/examples_python/introduction.ipynb) as a Jupyter notebook, shows the basic usage of the pairinteraction library in Python 3.\n",

    "By installing a [binary build of the pairinteraction software](https://github.com/pairinteraction/pairinteraction/releases), the pairinteraction library gets installed, too. For GNU/Linux, all dependencies of the pairinteraction library are installed automatically as well, and the library can be used right away. For Windows or OS X, we recommend the installation of the Python 3 distribution [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Then, the dependencies can be installed by executing ``conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pyzmq`` within the Anaconda terminal prompt."

We use the module `pireal` of the pairinteraction library as the calculations shown in this introduction require only real numbers (if one considers electric or magnetic fields with a non-zero $y$-value, complex numbers occur due to the definition of the spherical basis and one must use `picomplex`)."

The instance is then passed to every object of the pairinteraction library which needs to evaluates matrix elements. To speed up calculations, the intermediate results of the calculation of matrix elements are cached into memory. If a directory name is passed to the constructor of the class, the specified directory is used to store a SQLite database which holds the intermediate results, making them available to future program runs."

For two Rydberg atoms, the class `SystemTwo` is given. Both of these classes are used in a similar way: \n",

    "* Second, we specify whether symmetries of the systems should be taken into account to speed up calculations. The software generates a **list of basis vectors**, where each basis vector is a linear combination of the previously given Rydberg states. If symmetries are specified, they are applied to reduce the size of the basis. The basis vectors can be obtained as the columns of the matrix returned by `System[...].getBasis()`.\n",
