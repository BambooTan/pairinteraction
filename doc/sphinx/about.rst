=====

The pairinteraction software was originally developed by the Rydberg Quantum Optics group at the 5th Institute of Physics and the Institute for Theoretical Physics III of the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

Currently it is maintained by developers at the Institute for Theoretical Physics III of the University of Stuttgart in Germany, the Department of Physics of the University of Otago in New Zealand,
and the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy of the University of Southern Denmark in Denmark.

The software is written in C++ and Python. It is released fully open source under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. Binary installers are made available for many systems, including several GNU/Linux distributions,
Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. You can find them on the GitHub release page.
